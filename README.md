# Realtime UWP-SpokenChat
A simple "spoken" chat built using the Realtime Universal Windows Platform (UWP) SDK and the Windows Media SpeechRecognition API

This example can be used with the web chat demo available at [http://demos.realtime.co/demos/chat.aspx](http://demos.realtime.co/demos/chat.aspx)

## The Realtime Framework Pub/Sub messaging system
Part of the [The Realtime® Framework](http://framework.realtime.co), Realtime Cloud Messaging (aka ORTC) is a secure, fast and highly scalable cloud-hosted Pub/Sub real-time message broker for web and mobile apps.

If your website or mobile app has data that needs to be updated in the user’s interface as it changes (e.g. real-time stock quotes or ever changing social news feed) Realtime Cloud Messaging is the reliable, easy, unbelievably fast, “works everywhere” solution.

## The Universal Windows Platform
"Develop once for all Windows devices using a unified Windows runtime and VS tools that allow you to both support experiences unique to a device in XAML, HTML, and DirectX, and share the code that supports those experiences across all devices using C++, C#, or JavaScript. When your work is finished you can you can produce the app packages that you will submit to the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store with a single action to get your app out to customers on any Windows device."

## Get your own Realtime application key
For simplicity this example uses a demo Realtime application key with the authentication service disabled (every connection will have permission to publish and subscribe to any channel). For security guidelines please refer to the [Security Guide](http://messaging-public.realtime.co/documentation/starting-guide/security.html). 

**Don't forget to replace the demo key with your own application key. If you don't already own a free Realtime Framework application key, [get one now](https://accounts.realtime.co/signup/).**
